## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expecting to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/wiki/code-of-conduct).

## Getting Started

If you need to work on documentation, ensure you are in the `docs` directory within the main cypress repository.

The documentation in this repo are generated using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). You should
be able to install tools, build and start local `hexo` site.

From the `docs` directory:

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

This will install this repo's direct dependencies.

**Then, build the `public` directory and start the app:**

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Writing Documentation

### Links

Links are all handled through our [cypress.on](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-on) api.

Link all pages but their name (property key) in `source/_data/sidebar.yml`

- https://on.cypress.io/NAME_OF_PAGE
- https://on.cypress.io/and
- https://on.cypress.io/visit
- https://on.cypress.io/unit-testing-recipe
- https://on.cypress.io/introduction-to-cypress
- https://on.cypress.io/writing-your-first-test
- https://on.cypress.io/general-questions-faq

### Adding Examples

The documents outlining examples are within the [`source/examples`](/source/examples) directory. Each document is written in markdown with a little bit of [Hexo flair](https://hexo.io/docs/tag-plugins.html). To add an example to a document, just try to follow the formatting of any previous examples in the markdown file.

Add an associating image with the example within the [`source/img/examples`](/source/img/examples) directory. Each image should be resolution **715w x 480h**. Reference the image in the markdown document as follows:

```md
{% img /img/examples/name-of-file.jpg "alt text describing img" %}
```

## Commiting Code

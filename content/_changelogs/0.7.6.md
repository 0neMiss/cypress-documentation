## 0.7.6

*Released 06/23/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent infinite loop due to a trifecta of rare circumstances with [`.click()`](/api/commands/click). Clicking will now retry sync after it attempts to scroll past the element covering up the desired clickable element. Fixes [#46](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/46).

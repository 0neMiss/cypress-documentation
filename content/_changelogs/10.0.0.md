## 10.0.0

_Released TBD_

**Breaking Changes:**

**<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> Please read our
[Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes
in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 10.0.**

**Deprecations:**

**Features:**

- Enhanced `.within()` to provide visual indication of nested commands and logs.
  This improves the readability of logs and aligns the visual structure of logs
  with how tests are written by the user, which in turn makes dubugging easier.
  Addresses [#20433](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20433).

h2. Raw Notes

- Terminology

  - The Cypress App has been renamed from "Test Runner" to "Cypress App". When
    talking about test runners, we can say that the Cypress App is a test
    runner, but we should not refer to it as the test runner.

- The “Run all specs” and “Run filtered specs” functionality have been removed.

- The experimental “Cypress Studio” functionality has been removed and will be
  rethought/revisited in a later release

  - [Slack message](https://cypressio.slack.com/archives/C02560911D0/p1644506063676029?thread_ts=1644505161.655489&cid=C02560911D0)
  - See
    [the `experimentalStudio` option](https://www.notion.so/Changes-for-10-0-0-1dca213837b84d6ea297c2d12c615f3a)

- Cypress Configuration

  - Cypress has had several configuration options changes:

    - Changed:

      - The `baseUrl` option is no longer valid as a top-level configuration
        option; it must be defined within the `e2e` configuration object. This
        option is only applicable to E2E testing.

    - Added:

      - The `setupNodeEvents` option is new Test Type specific configuration
        option. It must be defined within the `e2e` and/or `component`
        configuration. This option accepts a function which allows you to
        modified your loaded configuration, listen to events and register
        plugins. This option replaced the `pluginsFile` option.
      - The `specPattern` option is new Test Type specific configuration option.
        It must be defined within the `e2e` and/or `component` configuration.
        This option accepts a glob pattern String or an Array of globs pattern
        Strings to. This option replaces using the `componentFolder` and
        `integrationFolder` options in conjunction with the `testFiles` option.
        **CONFIRM DASHBOARD SPEC HISTORY IS NOT IMPACTED.**
        - The `e2e.specPattern` default value is
          `cypress/e2e/**.cy*{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` - Previously the e2e spec files
          were discovered using the `integrationFolder` and `testFile`
          configuration, which defaulted to the pattern
          `cypress/integration/*/*.*`.
          - With this change, the we are suggesting you move you spec files to
            `cypress/e2e` and namespace your spec files with `.cy`.
        - The `component.specPattern` default value is
          `**/*.cy*{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` - Previously the e2e spec files were
          discovered using the `componentFolder` and `testFile` configuration,
          which had defaulted to the pattern `cypress/component/*/*.*`.
          - With this change, the migration workflow will suggest move you spec
            files to `cypress/e2e` and namespace your spec files with `.cy` to.
      - The `excludeSpecPattern` option is new Test Type specific configuration
        option. It must be defined within the `e2e` and/or `component`
        configuration. This option accepts a glob string pattern or array of
        globs string patterns which allows you to modified your loaded
        configuration, listen to events and register plugins. This option
        replaced the `ignoreTestFiles` option.
        - The `e2e.excludeSpecPattern` default value is `*.hot-update.js` -
          Previously this defaulted to the pattern `cypress/integration/*/*.*`.
        - The `component.excludeSpecPattern` default value is
          `['**/__snapshots__/*','**/__image_snapshots__/*']` - Previously this
          defaulted to the pattern `cypress/integration/*/*.*`.
        - The `**/node_modules/**` pattern is automatically added to both
          `e2e.specExcludePattern` and `component.specExcludePattern`, and does
          not need to be specified (and can't be overridden). This is consistent
          with <10.0 behavior.

    - Removed:
      - The `pluginsFile` option was removed. This option was replaced with the
        new `setupNodeEvents` option.
      - The `testFiles` option was removed. This option was replaced with the
        new `specPattern` option.
      - The `integrationFolder` option was removed. This option was made
        redundant with by the new `specPattern` option.
      - The `componentFolder` option was removed. This option was made redundant
        with by the new `specPattern` option.
      - The `ignoreTestFiles` option was removed. This option was replaced with
        the new `excludeSpecPattern` option.

  - The `testFiles` option has been re-name with `specPattern` to reflect that
    this option expects a regex pattern. Additionally, this is no longer a valid
    top-level configuration option. It must be defined within each testing type,
    `e2e` or `component`, to ensure the correct spec files are loaded.
    - The default `e2e.specPattern` value has been updated to
      `- `e2e.specPattern`default value is`cypress/e2e/**/\*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`**/\*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`from`
      -

# Configuration file

- `cypress.json` has been replaced by `cypress.config.js` or `cypress.config.ts`
- `cypress.json` will no longer be auto-generated by Cypress if no config file
  exists.
- The user will be able to choose which of the `cypress.config.js` or
  `cypress.config.ts` files is auto-generated by Cypress via a setup wizard when
  Cypress detects that no config file exists.
- Having both `cypress.config.js` and `cypress.config.ts` files will result in
  an error when Cypress loads.
- CoffeeScript config files (eg. `cypress.config.coffee`) are not supported
- The user will be able to use `--config-file` command line flag or the
  `configFile` module API option to specify a `.js` or `.ts` file, JSON config
  files are no longer supported.
- Cypress now requires a config file, so specifying `--config-file false` on the
  command line or a `configFile` value of `false` in the module API is no longer
  valid.
- A `defineConfig()` helper function is exported by Cypress, which provides
  automatic code completion for configuration in many popular code editors.

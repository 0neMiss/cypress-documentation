## 10.0.0

_Released TBD_

**Breaking Changes:**

**<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> Please read our
[Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes
in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 10.0.**

- We introduced several breaking changes to the Cypress configuration both the
  how the configuration is provided and to the configuration options themselves.
  For the a detailed explanation of these changes, please consult our
  [Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) amd use the 10.0
  migration workflow by running `cypress open` and selecting the project you
  would like to migrate. Breaking changes include:

  - Cypress Configuration File
    - Using a `cypress.json` configuration file is no longer valid and must be
      replaced with either a `cypress.config.js`, `cypress.config.ts`,
      `cypress.config.cjs` or `cypress.config.mjs` file. This change provide
      better flexibility and extensibility of configuration. With this change,
      If both a `cypress.json` file and `cypress.config.*` file is found or if
      the CLI flag of `-C,--config-file=*.json` is passed, an error will be
      thrown. Addressed in
      [#18221](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18221),
      [#18300](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18300) and
      [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).
    - A Cypress configuration file is now required and passing the CLI flag
      `-C,--config-file=false` will result in an error, where as previously
      Cypress accepted `-C,--config-file=false` to fallback to the Cypress
      default configuration values. By default Cypress will automatically load
      the config file that matches `cypress.config.{cjs,js,mjs,ts}` if the
      `-C,--config-file` CLI flag is not passed. Addressed in
      [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).
    - A default configuration file will no longer be auto-generated by Cypress
    if a configuration file does not exist. Instead, Cypress will take you
    through a Project Setup workflow in `open` mode. This allows you to
    customize the configuration setup by testing-type (E2E or Component Testing)
    and for the language and dependencies leveraged in your project.
    <!-- - [RECOMMENDATION] In 9.4.0 we added Intelligent Code Completion via the `defineConfig()` helper function. We encourage leveraging this helper while migrating your configuration. -->

- Updates have been made to allow users to add `cy.hover()` and `cy.mount()`
  customs commands using `Cypress.Commands.add()` since we suggested adding a
  custom command since we do not provide a default implementation. Previously
  users had to use `Cypress.Command.override()` to provide the custom command.
  Addresses [#18941](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18941).

- Removed Cypress Studio support.

**Deprecations:**

**Features:**

- Added support for `cypress.config.cjs` and `cypress.config.mjs` configuration
  files. Addressed in
  [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).

- Enhanced `.within()` to provide visual indication of nested commands and logs.
  Addresses [#20433](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20433).

**Bugfixes:**

- Improvements have been made to the error message in the scenario when a user
  would attempting to add a new command using `Cypress.Commands.add()` that has
  the same name as an internal function reserved by Cypress. The improved error
  message explains why the command name must be changed where previously a Type
  Error was thrown without relevant information. Addresses
  [#6146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6146).

**Dependencies:**

  https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18473

- Terminology

  - The Cypress App has been renamed from "Test Runner" to "Cypress App". When
    talking about test runners, we can say that the Cypress App is a test
    runner, but we should not refer to it as the test runner.

- The “Run all specs” and “Run filtered specs” functionality have been removed.

- The experimental “Cypress Studio” functionality has been removed and will be
  rethought/revisited in a later release. A warning will be displayed in both
  `open` and `run` mode to warn the user uses this flag is set to inform them
  that this has been removed so that they don't think it's a working feature
  that is broken. https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20515

## Cypress Configuration

- We introduced several breaking changes to the Cypress configuration both the
  how the configuration is provided and to the configuration options themselves.
  For the a detailed explanation of these changes, please consult the migration
  guide and/or use the 10.0 migration workflow by running `cypress open` and
  selecting the project you would like to migrate. Breaking changes include:

  - The `cypress.json` configuration file is no longer valid and must be
    replaced with either a `cypress.config.js`, `cypress.config.ts`,
    `cypress.config.cjs` or `cypress.config.mjs` file. If both a `cypress.json`
    file and `cypress.config.*` file is found, or if multiple flavors of
    `cypres.config.*` are found, an error will be thrown. This change provide
    better flexibility and extensibility of configuration.
  - A Cypress configuration file is now required, where as previously Cypress
    accepted the CLI flag of `-C,--config-file=false` to fallback to the Cypress
    default configuration values. By default Cypress will automatically load the
    config file that matches `cypress.config.{cjs,js,mjs,ts}` if a the
    `-C,--config-file` CLI flag is not passed. With this change, if a
    configuration file is not found, in `run` mode, Cypress will fail and in
    `open` mode, Cypress will take you through the Project Setup workflow.

  - Running Cypress in a new, non-configured project will no longer
    automatically scaffolled the a defaul ct configuration file

  - Cypress has had several configuration options changes:

    - Changed:

      - The `baseUrl` option is no longer valid as a top-level configuration
        option; it must be defined within the `e2e` configuration object. This
        option is only applicable to E2E testing.
      - `supportFile` option has bene updated to be specific to testing-type. It
        was `cypress/support/index.js` by default. It is now set like
        `e2e.supportFile` and `component.supportFile` and the defaults are
        `cypress/support/e2e.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` and
        `cypress/support/component.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` respectively.
        https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19776,
        https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19364

    - Added:

      - The `setupNodeEvents` option is new Test Type specific configuration
        option. It must be defined within the `e2e` and/or `component`
        configuration. This option accepts a function which allows you to
        modified your loaded configuration, listen to events and register
        plugins. This option replaced the `pluginsFile` option.
        https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18798 &
        https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20560
      - The `specPattern` option is new Test Type specific configuration option.
        It must be defined within the `e2e` and/or `component` configuration.
        This option accepts a glob pattern String or an Array of globs pattern
        Strings to. This option replaces using the `componentFolder` and
        `integrationFolder` options in conjunction with the `testFiles` option.
        **CONFIRM DASHBOARD SPEC HISTORY IS NOT IMPACTED.**
        - The `e2e.specPattern` default value is
          `cypress/e2e/**.cy*{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` - Previously the e2e spec files
          were discovered using the `integrationFolder` and `testFile`
          configuration, which defaulted to the pattern
          `cypress/integration/*/*.*`.
          - With this change, the we are suggesting you move you spec files to
            `cypress/e2e` and namespace your spec files with `.cy`.
        - The `component.specPattern` default value is
          `**/*.cy*{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` - Previously the e2e spec files were
          discovered using the `componentFolder` and `testFile` configuration,
          which had defaulted to the pattern `cypress/component/*/*.*`.
          - With this change, the migration workflow will suggest move you spec
            files to `cypress/e2e` and namespace your spec files with `.cy` to.
      - The `excludeSpecPattern` option is new Test Type specific configuration
        option. It must be defined within the `e2e` and/or `component`
        configuration. This option accepts a glob string pattern or array of
        globs string patterns which allows you to modified your loaded
        configuration, listen to events and register plugins. This option
        replaced the `ignoreTestFiles` option. Pt1:
        https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319 & Pt2:
        https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19980
        - The `e2e.excludeSpecPattern` default value is `*.hot-update.js` -
          Previously this defaulted to the pattern `cypress/integration/*/*.*`.
        - The `component.excludeSpecPattern` default value is
          `['**/__snapshots__/*','**/__image_snapshots__/*']` - Previously this
          defaulted to the pattern `cypress/integration/*/*.*`.
        - The `**/node_modules/**` pattern is automatically added to both
          `e2e.specExcludePattern` and `component.specExcludePattern`, and does
          not need to be specified (and can't be overridden). This is consistent
          with <10.0 behavior.

    - Removed:
      - The `pluginsFile` option was removed. This option was replaced with the
        new `setupNodeEvents` option. Adding the `pluginsFile` option will now
        result in an error. https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18798 &
        https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20560
      - The `testFiles` option was removed. This option was replaced with the
        new `specPattern` option. Adding the `testFiles` option will now result
        in an error. https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319 &
        https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20565
      - The `integrationFolder` option was removed. This option was made
        redundant with by the new `specPattern` option.
        https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319
      - The `componentFolder` option was removed. This option was made redundant
        with by the new `specPattern` option.
        https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319
      - The `ignoreTestFiles` option was removed. This option was replaced with
        the new `excludeSpecPattern` option.
        https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319

  - The `testFiles` option has been re-name with `specPattern` to reflect that
    this option expects a regex pattern. Additionally, this is no longer a valid
    top-level configuration option. It must be defined within each testing type,
    `e2e` or `component`, to ensure the correct spec files are loaded.
    https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319
    - The default `e2e.specPattern` value has been updated to
      `cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` from `**/*.*` (integrationFolder +
      test files pattern's full regex of `cypress/integration/**/*`)
    - The default `component.specPattern` value has been updated to
      `**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` from `**/*.*` (componentFolder + test files
      pattern's full regex of `cypress/component/**/*`)

<!-- - ~R `cypress.json` has been replaced by `cypress.config.js`, `cypress.config.ts`,
  `cypress.config.cjs` or `cypress.config.mjs`:~ -->

- `cypress.json` will no longer be auto-generated by Cypress if no config file
  exists.
- R The user will be able to choose which of the `cypress.config.js` or
  `cypress.config.ts` files is auto-generated by Cypress via a setup wizard when
  <!-- Cypress detects that no config file exists.
- ~R Having both `cypress.config.js` and `cypress.config.ts` files will result
  in an error when Cypress loads.~ -->
- R CoffeeScript config files (eg. `cypress.config.coffee`) are not supported
- R T he user will be able to use `--config-file` command line flag or the
`configFile` module API option to specify a `.js` or `.ts` file, JSON config
files are no longer supported.
<!-- - R Cypress now requires a config file, so specifying `--config-file false` on the
  command line or a `configFile` value of `false` in the module API is no longer
  valid. -->

## Starting Again 5/11/2022

- LaunchPad (Desktop Gui)

  - Updates have been made to the Cypress Application launched in either open
    mode or global mode.

    - Previously, you would open Cypress with a specific testing type specified
      with a CLI flag (e2e by default) and then you would be shown the list of
      specs available to run for that project and testing type. You would then
      select a spec and it would launch in the specified browser to run the
      tests found in that spec. You would have to close the browser and navigate
      back to the Cypress Application to change specs or would have to close
      Cypress to change between e2e testing and component testing. This was a
      fragmented experience.
    - Now, when you can launch Cypress in open mode you will be asked which
      testing type you would like to test, E2E or component testing. Once you
      select the testing type, you select the browser you want to test in and
      the browser will open to show the list of specs available to run for that
      project and testing type. Switching between specs happened within the
      browser, giving a better development experience all in one place. To
      switch between specs, instead of closing and re-launching Cypress, you can
      simply switch testing types and re-launch the browser to test in.

  - Project Setup Flows

    - Cypress now provides project step flows for both e2e and ct testing to
      provide quick Cypress setup. These flows replace the boilerplate,
      auto-scaffolding that occurred in <10.0 when a Cypress configuration file
      was not detected in the project root. These flow share information on the
      files generated by Cypress why they are important and gives users the
      opportunities to select the setup configuration that fit their project's
      needs.

  - Project Migration

    - Cypress 10.0 had quite a few configuration changes to clarify what
      configurations were leveraged by each testing type. To assist with
      updating to Cypress 10.0, when Cypress detected you have a cypress.json
      file in your project, it will guide you through the project migration flow
      to ensure your project works as expected with the new and changed
      configuration options. There is a migration flow for both e2e testing and
      for component testing and you will be guided through each separately, if
      previously configured, to ensure

- Browser View:

  - The spec list shown in Cypress open mode now shows the github history next
    to the spec to provide details on when and who last touched a spec file.

  with error when Cypress 10+ is launched in global mode and the user tried to
  open and migrating a project with Cypress 9 installed with the project's
  package.json. ((It's possible to launch Cypress 10 in global mode with the
  --global flag. If the user then attempts to migrate a Cypress 9 project using
  the globally launched Cypress 10, we will generate Cypress 10 APIs
  (cypress.config.js, etc). If they later try to launch their Cypress 9 project,
  using it's locally installed Cypress 9, it will fail, since it will be
  expecting things like cypress.json, not cypress.config.js.))
- [#21193](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21193)Do not migrate the
  user's spec to use `.cy.` pre-extension if the project has a Cypress Dashboard
  projectId in the config and add a custom specPattern in the config file. The
  reason behind this change is to keep the spec history on the cloud.

- [#21195](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21195) Correctly
  migrations custom testFiles and componentFolder to specPattern API, even if
  project has no specs. Also improves indentation, since we don't bundle
  prettier anymore, by using @babel/generator instead, which is smaller
  bundlephobia.

Migration / Setup - Language Detection

- [#21220](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21220) better language
  detection in migration/setup workflow
- [#21323](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21323)Projects that don't
  use typescript and have a type of module will now have their cypress.config.js
  file properly scaffolded
- [#21227](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21227) prettier in
  migration changes

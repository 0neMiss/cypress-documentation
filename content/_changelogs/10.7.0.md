## 10.7.0

_Released 8/30/2022_

**Features:**

- Re-introduces the experimental
  [Cypress Studio feature](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/cypress-studio).
  Cypress Studio provides a visual way to generate tests within Cypress by
  recording interactions against the application under test. Cypress Studio is
  available only in end-to-end tests, and must be enabled via the
  `experimentalStudio` flag. Addresses
  [#23461](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23461)
- Adds [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) component testing support. Addresses
  [#23431](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23431) and
  [#23432](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23432).
- The "Latest Runs" and "Average Duration" columns in the specs list now provide
  actions when hovered over to assist with the process of connecting the project
  to the Cypress Dashboard. Addresses
  [#22932](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22932)
- New informational banners will display instructions to assist with connecting
  projects to the Cypress Dashboard and recording a first test run. Users who
  don't plan to use the Cypress Dashboard can dismiss the banners to not see
  them in the future. Addresses
  [#22933](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22933),
  [#22934](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22934),
  [#22798](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22798), and
  [#22935](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22935)
- Vue.js projects with a custom spec pattern configuration can now use the
  "Create Spec from Component" capability introduced in v10.5.0. Addresses
  [#23071](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23071)
- Angular component testing projects can provide a custom configuration to the
  Webpack dev server using the `projectConfig` key. This enables support for
  projects that don't adhere to Angular CLI conventions. Addresses
  [#23161](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23161)
- The Cypress `clock` can now be set to a new time using the `setSystemTime`
  function. Addresses
  [#15424](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15424)

**Performance:**

- The `cy.session()` command's behavior has been enhanced to no longer clear the
  dom after a validation function runs. This means a `cy.visit()` command is no
  longer required after running `cy.session()` when a validation function is
  used. Addresses [#22368](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22368).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where Cypress could crash if a websocket upgrade request was
  made over HTTPS. Fixes
  [#22217](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22217)
- Fixed an issue where filtering with the `--spec` run mode option would not
  find any specs if the project was located at the root directory of a file
  system. Fixes [#23380](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23380)
- Fixed an issue where projects using Angular v14.2.0 and above would be unable
  to run component tests. Fixes
  [#23585](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23585)
- Fixed an issue where snapshots performed in XHR requests could reflect the
  primary domain instead of current domain. Fixes
  [#21496](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21496)
- Introduced a new `GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT` environment variable when claiming specs
  from Cypress Cloud to address a potential scenario that would cause invalid
  Github Action requests to be accepted. Addressed in
  [#23445](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23445)
- Fixed an issue where an internal TypeScript type was exposed globally. Fixes
  [#23333](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23333)
- Fixed an issue where an incomplete `devServer` configuration would cause the
  specs list to not display in the Cypress App. Fixes
  [#23486](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23486)

**Miscellaneous:**

- Display a default icon in the browser selection menu for browsers without
  bundled icons. Fixes
  [#21766](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21766)

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded the bundled TypeScript version shipped with Cypress from `4.2.3` to
  `4.7.4`. Addressed in
  [#22252](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/22252).

Addresses [#566](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/566).

**Bugfixes:**

- It is no longer necessary to return the config from the plugins function when using the `dev-server:start` event for component testing. Fixes [#16860](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16860).
- Expanded the types for `CyHttpMessages.BaseMessage.headers` to support the value being an array of strings. Fixes [#16734](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16734).
- `cy.intercept()` now correctly sets the response body as a string instead of an ArrayBuffer when it contains multi-byte characters. Fixes [#16292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16292).
- The typings for `CyHttpMessages.BaseMessage.headers` were improved so that methods like `filter`, `slice`, etc. are more accurate. Fixes [#16734](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16734).
- `cy.intercept()` won't corrupt certain binary responses. Fixes [#16722](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16722).
- Cypress no longer hangs intermittently when using webpack 5. Fixes [#15447](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15447).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Added `enquirer` dependency. Fixes [#16846](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16846).

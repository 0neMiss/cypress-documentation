[Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes
in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 8.0.**

- When running `cypress run` previous to 8.0, some browsers would launch headed
  while others were launched headless by default. Cypress now runs all browsers
  during `cypress run` as headless by default. Addresses
  [#16832](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16832).
- The default screen size when running a headless browser has been reverted back
  to 1280x720 pixels. Addresses
  [#16853](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16853).

**Features:**

- You can now configure certificate authority (CA) and client certificates to
  use within tests on a per-URL basis via a `clientCertificates` . See See
  [Client certificates](/guides/references/client-certificates) for more detail.

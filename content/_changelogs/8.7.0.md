## 8.7.0

_Released 10/25/2021_

**Features:**

- Users can pass `overwrite: true` option to `Cypress.Screenshot.defaults` to
  change default behavior to overwrite existing screenshots without having to
  set `overwrite` for each `cy.screenshot()` command. Addresses
  [#7955](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7955).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression introduced in [8.6.0](#8-6-0) where videos recorded in
  Electron to the Dashboard were not playable in the Firefox or Safari browser
  and were not compatible with QuickTime player in MacOS.
- Fixed a regression introduced in [8.6.0](#8-6-0) so that the warning about the
  `projectRoot` directory not being writeable will now display correctly. Fixes
  [#18485](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18485).
- Improved the error message when running Cypress without non-root permissions.
  Fixes [#18445](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18445).
- An error now throws when invalid options are passed to the `selectorPriority`
  configuration option of `Cypress.SelectorPlayground.defaults`. Valid values
  are `data-*`, `id`, `class`, `tag`, `attribute`, or `nth-child`. Fixes
  [#7745](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7745).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Pinned resolution of `ua-parser-js` to `0.7.24` to avoid dependency resolution
  to the compromised package versions. Please read the
  [security advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pjwm-rvh2-c87w) and
  take actions advised as soon as possible. Addressed in
  [#18611](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18611)

## 9.4.0

_Released 1/31/2022_

**Features**

- Enhancements were made to `.selectFile()` feedback receiving after it's
  initial release in [9.3.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-3-0).
  - The default behavior was updated to automatically infers the mime type of
    files based on their extension to correctly encode file uploads. Addressed
    in [#19751](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19751).
  - Added the `mimeType` property to allow users to explicitly set the mime type
    on files using the `mimeType` property. Addressed in
    [#19751](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19751).
  - Updated file contents types to allow either a
    [`TypedArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray)
    instance or a `Cypress.Buffer` instance, where previously file contents were
    expected to only be an instance of `Cypress.Buffer`. Addressed in
    [#19751](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19751).
  - Updated `.selectFile()` to retains the fileName of files read from disk to
    work with aliases. Addressed in
    [#19803](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19803).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in [9.3.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-3-0) to correctly
  parse the `--spec` CLI parameter for glob patterns containing a range. Fixes
  [#19783](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19783).

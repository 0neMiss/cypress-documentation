## 9.5.2

_Released 3/14/2022_

**Features:**

- Enhancements were made to the pre-release build setup such that Cypress will
  use a unique cache folder per-release installation on a machine. This removes
  the need to run `cypress clear cache` before installing a new pre-release
  version of Cypress or before installing a new released version of Cypress
  after a pre-release version had been installed. Addressed in
  [#20296](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pulls/20296).
- Updates were made to explicitly disable the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header for
  proxied responses to ensure `document.domain` can continue to be set with
  Chrome v106+. This was necessary because Chrome is planning to make
  [`document.domain` immutable](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/immutable-document-domain/)
  in v106+ to relax the same-origin policy by interpreting the
  `Origin-Agent-Cluster` has `true`, where as it is currently interpreted as
  `false`. Addresses
  [#20147](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20147).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue with `.type()` where click events could be fired on the
  incorrect target element because the target focus changed within a key-down
  event handler callback. Fixed in
  [#20525](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pulls/20525).
- Fixed a regression in [9.5.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-5-0) where ANSI
  colors were not removed from the FireFox warning message about the
  `chromeWebSecurity` configuration option having no effect on the Firefox
  browser. Fixes [#20496](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20496).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `url-parse` dependency from `1.5.6` to `1.5.9` to address multiple
  NVD security vulnerabilities. This update avoids authorization bypass through
  user-controlled key due to `url-parse` v1.5.7
  [CVE-2022-0639](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0639) and
  `url-parse` v1.5.8
  [CVE-2022-0686](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0686). This also
  avoids authorization bypass caused by adding a backspace character to the
  input [CVE-2022-0691](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0691).
  Addressed in [#20386](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20386) and
  [#20439](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20439).

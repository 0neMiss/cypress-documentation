## 9.5.3

_Released 3/28/2022_

**Bugfixes:**

- Corrected an issue with `cy.intercept()` where the response status code and
  response body were sometimes missing from the log details in `open` mode.
  Fixed [#18757](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18757).

- Fixed an issue in `cy.readFile()` where the command would not retry or provide
  a meaningful error message if `null` encoding was used and the file was not
  found. Fixed [#20683](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20683).

- Updated the Cypress Keyboard shortcuts to only run the shortcut when the
  pressed shortcut key was not used in conjunction with either the `alt`,
  `ctrl`, or `shift` modifier keys. This fixed an issue where the Cypress
  shortcut handler would override the a browser native keyboard shortcut for
  search (`ctrl + f`). Fixed
  [#20222](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20222).

- Fix the `Cypress.Buffer` TypeScript type to reference the static constructor
  where it was incorrectly referencing the `Buffer` instance which caused Type
  errors. Fixes [#20542](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20542).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `minimist` dependency from `1.2.5` to `1.2.6`. Addressed in
  [#20756](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20756).

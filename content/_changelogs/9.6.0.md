## 9.6.0

_Released 4/25/2022_

**Features:**

- TO DO: Add cy.origin info.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue with Firefox 98+ where the Enter keystroke was not being sent
  to an input element when using `.type('{enter})`. Fixed
  [#21033](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21033).
- When Cypress is interrupted by the user while tests are running, Cypress was
  incorrectly reporting an error message that indicate a plugin crashed. Updates
  were make to verify if the interruption was signaled by the user or if it
  indeed came from an error in a plugin before showing error message. Fixed
  [#21010](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21010).
- Improved the error message observed on Windows platforms when unzipping the
  Cypress binary and the max file length is exceeded. The error now include a
  link to the mitigation steps a user can take to enable long paths on the
  system which should allow for a successful install. Fixed in
  [#21047](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21047).
- Updated the `Cypress.Commands.add()` TypeScript types to better reflect the
  attributes of the `.add()` utility and the JQuery element, a possible previous
  subject type. [#20376](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20376).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` dependency from `15.3.5` to `15.5.1` to consume fixes
  related to
  [improve performance](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/33406) on
  macOS Big Sur and later. Addressed
  [#21068](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21068).

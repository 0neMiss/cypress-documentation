# 3.6.1

*Released 11/08/2019*

**Bugfixes:**

- The Electron browser no longer hangs when testing applications that have a prompt in a `beforeunload` handler. Fixes {% issue 2118 %}.
- When using {% url "`cy.setCookie()`" setcookie %} with the same `options` Object, Cypress now correctly sets the new cookie instead of the one passed into a previous {% url "`cy.setCookie()`" setcookie %}. Fixes {% issue 2701 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} causing text after using modifier keys in {% url "`.type()` type %} to not be typed. Fixes {% issue 5622 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where HTTP redirects could cause strange behavior, including cookies not being set as expected, leading to authentication issues and other problems. Fixes {% issue 5436 %} and {% issue 5432 %}.
- Cypress now sends the expected headers or request body in a `cy.visit()` to an HTTPS URL using the default port, 443. Fixes {% issue 5367 %}.
- Cypress no longer crashes with the error `Failed to parse or set cookie named "xxx"` when loading certain websites. Fixes {% issue 4990 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where {% url "`cy.clearCookie()`" clearcookie %} would not act as expected when using certain `baseUrls`. Fixes {% issue 5453 %}.
- Fixed a bug where Cypress would appear frozen after cancelling user login while in the "Runs" tab. Fixes {% issue 5631 %}.
- Fixed a bug where element visibility did not properly account for `backface-visibility: hidden;` Now, with `backface-visibility: hidden` and `rotateX(180deg)`, `to.be.hidden` is `true`. Fixes {% issue 2985 %}.
- Fixed a bug where failing Cypress commands would incorrectly throw `cannot read property 'replace' of undefined` if the error's stack was `undefined`. Fixes {% issue 1669 %}.

**Misc:**

- Types for `.rightclick()` and `.dblclick()` have been updated to correctly reflect their accepted options. Addresses {% issue 5617 %}.
- Increase CDP timeout to 20 seconds; add logs after 5 seconds. Addresses {% issue 5610 %}.
- Remove deprecated usage of Promise.pending. Addresses {% issue 5611 %}.
- We're continuing to make process in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Addresses {% issue 2690 %} in {% PR 5556 %}

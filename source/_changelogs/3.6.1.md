**Bugfixes:**

- The Electron browser no longer hangs when testing applications that have a prompt in a `beforeunload` handler. Fixes {% issue 2118 %}.

- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} causing text after using modifier keys in {% url "`.type()` type %} to not be typed. Fixes {% issue 5622 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where HTTP redirects could cause strange behavior, including cookies not being set as expected, leading to authentication issues and other problems. Fixes {% issue 5436 %} and {% issue 5432 %}.
- Cypress now sends the expected headers or request body in a `cy.visit()` to an HTTPS URL using the default port, 443. Fixes {% issue 5367 %}.
- Cypress no longer crashes with the error `Failed to parse or set cookie named "xxx"` when loading certain websites. Fixes {% issue 4990 %}.

- The 'Log In' modal within Cypress when setting up a project now correctly closes when manually closed. Fixes {% issue 5631 %}.
- Elements with `backface-visibility: hidden;` are now accounted for when asserting on the elemtent's visibility. Fixes {% issue 2985 %}.

**Misc:**

- Types for `.rightclick()` and `.dblclick()` have been updated to correctly reflect their accepted options. Addresses {% issue 5617 %}.

# 3.7.0

*Released 11/25/2019*

**Features:**

- Cypress now includes the full list of browsers found and their properties within the Cypress configuration. This means that the `browsers` array is also editable within plugins by accessing `config.browsers`. The currently available browsers are also displayed within the configuration panel under Settings in the Test Runner. Addresses {% issue 5067 %}.
- Environment variables within GitHub Actions are now detected and passed to the Dashboard in order to display the proper {% url "git information" continuous-integration#Git-information %} for recorded runs. Fixes {% issue 5609 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.6.1" changelog-3-6-1 %} where {% url "cy.request()" request %} with `followRedirect: false` would fail if a `Set-Cookie` header was present in the response. Fixes {% issue 5654 %}.
- The context of `window` is no longer `undefined` within the application under test when called within a `setTimeout` during strict mode. Fixes {% issue 5707 %}.
- Cypress now captures the SHA of builds generated through Travis CI during pull requests. This should resolve issues with Cypress status checks sometimes not running within {% url "GitHub Integration" github-integration %}. Fixes {% issue 5728 %}.
- Cypress now automatically strips double quotes from {% url "`--ci-build-id`" command-line#cypress-run-ci-build-id-lt-id-gt %} and {% url "`group`" command-line#cypress-run-group-lt-name-gt %} flag arguments during `cypress run`. Fixes {% issue 5686 %}.
- Assertions printed in the {% url "Command Log" test-runner#Command-Log %} now correctly identify integers from string integers. Fixes {% issue 25 %}.
- Empty spaces are now accurately reflected in the {% url "Command Log" test-runner#Command-Log %} within assertions. Fixes {% issue 1360 %}.
- Keys printed in the {% url "Command Log" test-runner#Command-Log %} when using the `have.all.keys` assertion now correctly display. Fixes {% issue 753 %}.
- We fixed an issue where Cypress would throw an error when using {% url "`cy.visit()`" visit %} on a `cleverapp.io` domain. Fixes {% issue 5722 %}.

**Misc:**

- The configuration object returned from the plugins file is now validated and will throw a helpful error message when invalid. Addresses {% issue 5712 %}.
- The configuration panel under Settings in the Test Runner now has a white background for better readability. Also each configuration option with nested properties is now collapsible. Addressed in {% PR 5068 %}.

**Dependency Updates**

- Upgraded `parse-domain` from `2.0.0` to `2.3.4`. Addressed in {% PR 5726 %}.

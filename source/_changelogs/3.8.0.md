# 3.8.0

*Released XX/XX/2019*

**Features:**

- Cypress now accepts a `--tag` argument to be used to identify separate runs. Any tags assigned will be shown on the run in the Cypress Dashboard. Addresses {% issue 2561 %}.
- The commands {% url "`.its()`" its %} and {% url "`.invoke()`" invoke %} now accept an `options` object to allow changing logging options. Addresses {% issue 1450 %}.
- Cypress will now attempt to use the `unzip` binary during `cypress install` before trying the slower, Node.js-based unzipping method. Addresses {% issue 3803 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where Cypress would crash on Windows when trying to pass a url through `--config` or `--env` command line flags. Fixes {% issue 5466 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where calling `.type({ force: true })` on hidden inputs would not type the correct characters. Fixes {% issue 5835 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where {% url "`.type()`" type %} was not respecting previous selections if the current value of the input was the same as the key. This also fixed an where {% url "`.type()`" type %} would not respect previous selections in non-selectionRange inputs (like email or number inputs). Fixes {% issue 5703 %}.
- .should("be.visible") doesn't interpet elements with " style='transform: scale(0,0)' " correctly. Fixes {% issue 723 %}.

**Misc:**

- {% url "`cy.viewport()`" viewport %} now allows for viewport sizes up to 8,000 pixels. Addresses {% issue 5871 %}.
- We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Addresses {% issue 2690 %} in {% PR 5643 %}.

# 4.6.0

*Released 5/11/2020*

**Features:**

- {% url "Errors" debugging#Errors %} in the Test Runner now display a code frame to preview where the failure occurred with the relevant file, line number, and column number highlighted. Clicking on the file link will open the file in your {% url "preferred file opener" IDE-integration#File-Opener-Preference %} and highlight the line and column in editors that support it. Addresses {% issue 3762 %}.
- Cypress now utilizes {% url "source maps" debugging#Source-maps %} to enhance the error experience. Stack traces are translated so that your source files are shown instead of the generated file that is loaded by the browser. Cypress will include an inline source map in your spec file. If you {% url "modify the preprocessor" preprocessors-api %}, ensure that inline source maps are enabled to get the same experience. Addresses {% issue 881 %}, {% issue 1761 %} and {% issue 3966 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- Default {% url "TypeScript" typescript-support %} options are now set to `module: commonJS` which Node.js and the browser expect. This fixes a situation where setting a different module in a `tsconfig.json` would cause errors to throw if you had `export`, `import` or `async` keywords in your code. Fixes {% issue 7005 %}, {% issue 7011 %}, {% issue 7043 %}, and {% issue 7151 %}.
- Cypress no longer displays `onError is not a function` when a browser can't connect. Fixes {% issue 7217 %}.
- You can now pass the `force: true` option to {% url "`.select()`" select %} to select options within a disabled `<select>`. Addresses {% issue 107 %}.
- We now throw an error when attempting to {% url "`.select()`" select %} an `<option>` within a disabled `<optgroup>`. Fixes {% issue 7226 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "4.3.0" changelog-4-3-0 %} where the message output during errors were not formatted correctly. Fixes {% issue 6924 %}.
- Using {% url "`Cypress._.capitalize`" _ %} now correctly behaves the same as Lodash's capitalize method. Fixes {% issue 7222 %}.
- When clicking on a component spec while using {% url "`experimentalComponentTesting`" experiments %}, the correct file is now watched without assuming it is an integration file. Fixes {% issue 7244 %}.
- Firefox video recording no longer crashes Cypress when running very short spec files. Fixes {% issue 6408 %}.

**Misc:**

- We now export `Cypress.ConfigOptions` types as a partial of the full options interface. Addresses {% issue 7238 %}.
- We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Addresses {% issue 2690 %} in {% PR 7162 %}, {% PR 7216 %}, {% PR 7227 %}, and {% PR 7232 %}.

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` from `8.2.3` to `8.2.5`. Addressed in {% PR 7236 %}.

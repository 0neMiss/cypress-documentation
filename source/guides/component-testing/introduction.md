- What Component Testing is
- How Component Testing works with Cypress
{% endnote %}

**Component testing is a feature that is experimental.** You can enable component testing by setting the `experimentalComponentTesting` configuration to `true`.

# Component Libraries

Component testing can be used with the libraries below. You can find more details on integration with each library in their respective repo.

- **React:** {% url "cypress-react-unit-test" https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test %}
- **Vue:** {% url "cypress-vue-unit-test" https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-vue-unit-test %}

# Component Folder

By default `cypress/component` is the path for component tests. You can change this path by setting the `componentFolder` configuration option.

**Example `cypress.json`**

```json
{
  "experimentalComponentTesting": true,
  "componentFolder": "cypress/component"
}
```

# Example

An example of a component test may look like the code below. This test would execute in the browser, similar to the full end-to-end test, except with no URL website being visited.

```js
import { mount } from 'cypress-react-unit-test'
import Post from './Post.jsx'

describe('Post skeletons', () => {
  it('loads title after timeout', () => {
    mount(<Post title={title} children={text} />)
    // and then use regular Cypress commands
    // at first, the title and the text are ðŸ’€
    cy.get('h1 .react-loading-skeleton').should('have.length', 1)
    cy.get('p .react-loading-skeleton').should('have.length', 5)
  })
})
```
